										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renting a beautiful, modern one-bedroom in a new condo building (completed 2012) one block from Penn Station and MSG. Queen bed, large living room couch, full kitchen, washer/dryer unit, fireplace. Huge terrace with covered furniture. Ultra clean.</p>
<p>Some unique amenities: private outdoor terrace, an electric fireplace, private washer/dryer. It&#8217;s right by Penn Station, which means you have instant access to all the subways, buses, and trains. Only 10 blocks from Times Square, a few blocks from Herald Square, and at the north part of Chelsea and Madison Square Park. You&#8217;ll have a one bedroom apartment with a big couch in the living room, and a full kitchen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This chic and cool studio apartment in a charming Victorian home in Cole Valley merges the best of San Francisco, with classic 19th century architecture on the exterior, and a newly remodeled, beautiful studio apartment that features mod design and a cheerful and vibrant color scheme in the interior.</p>
<p>There is a fully outfitted kitchen with 4 stools and retro-chic tableware, perfect for cocktails. And speaking of cocktails, the neighborhood is lovely if you like great food and cocktails. A close walk to Cole Street, you can feast on gourmet tacos and drinks at local favorite Padrecito, topping it off with caramelized honey, creme fraiche and roasted pineapple sundaes at the Ice Cream Bar, also a fan favorite on Cole Street.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to an original, atypical Paris stay on the river in front of the world&#8217;s most iconic landmark &#8211; sparkling at night! View from Montmartre (Sacré Coeur) to the Bir Hakeim Bridge &#8211; an amazing iron structure shown in many movies (Last Tango in Paris, Inception&#8230;).</p>
<p>My beautiful and spacious second floor walk up offers a private bedroom that comfortably fits two. Walking distance to the best eats on Randolph Street&#8217;s restaurant row, cta&#8217;s blue line, and West Town bars.</p>
<p>Many public transit :<br />
*BatoBus : shuttle service on the river, pass for several days, main spots in Paris.<br />
*bus 72 all along the Seine (direct for Concorde, Louvre, Hotel de Ville)<br />
*metro Passy, 4 stations to Champs Elysées<br />
*RER ligne C direct to Musée d&#8217;Orsay, Invalides, ND cathedrale, Quartier Latin&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renting a beautiful, modern one-bedroom in a new condo building (completed 2012) one block from Penn Station and MSG. Queen bed, large living room couch, full kitchen, washer/dryer unit, fireplace. Huge terrace with covered furniture. Ultra clean.</p>
<p>Some unique amenities: private outdoor terrace, an electric fireplace, private washer/dryer. It&#8217;s right by Penn Station, which means you have instant access to all the subways, buses, and trains. Only 10 blocks from Times Square, a few blocks from Herald Square, and at the north part of Chelsea and Madison Square Park. You&#8217;ll have a one bedroom apartment with a big couch in the living room, and a full kitchen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The guest apartment has its own entrance located on the ground level of our home. The private apartment is 720 sq and has 8 ft ceilings. The living room and kitchen are new and the bath and the two bedrooms are remodeled.</p>
<p>The apartment gets tons of light and comes with modern amenities including centralized heat/AC (vital in both the summer and winter months), 50 inch HD-TV, high-speed wireless, dishwasher, and washer and dryer in the basement. It has a roomy interior with an open kitchen and spacious bathroom, and comes fully furnished with loveseat, futon, coffee/dining table and chairs, desk, and queen-sized bed. Up to 4 people can sleep. Fresh linens and towels provided, as well as free advice on tourist attractions and assistance in traveling around NYC if needed! My assistant, Alice, lives just a few minutes away, and is on hand to handle all of your questions and needs.</p>

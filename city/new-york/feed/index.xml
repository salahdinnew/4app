										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This spacious and modern 1 bedroom with balcony is located on Essex and Stanton in the Lower East Side (close to the Hotel on Rivington) in a brand new building with elevator and a rooftop deck with spectacular city views.</p>
<p>The apartment gets tons of light and comes with modern amenities including centralized heat/AC (vital in both the summer and winter months), 50 inch HD-TV, high-speed wireless, dishwasher, and washer and dryer in the basement. It has a roomy interior with an open kitchen and spacious bathroom, and comes fully furnished with loveseat, futon, coffee/dining table and chairs, desk, and queen-sized bed. Up to 4 people can sleep. Fresh linens and towels provided, as well as free advice on tourist attractions and assistance in traveling around NYC if needed!

					<description><![CDATA[The room was very comfortable, the shower pressure and heat was perfect, the bathroom very clean. The view from their back deck was the highlight for us- and they were very kind to share the view! We enjoyed some wine and Turkish sweets on the deck for our last night. Additionally, the neighborhood is perfect!! Every corner there is a bar or restaurant or someone squeezing fresh juice for you. I would highly recommend this place!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Few other considerations are in order: 1. The location is mediocre at best. Finding their place is a challenge; more importantly, its hillside location is hard on the legs, no matter who you are. Yes, it sits in a trendy, less touristy neighborhood, but the upcoming Karakoy district is also trendy, closer to the museums and the water,and a much, much easier walk. 2. The guest bed is not very comfortable and should be replaced. 3. While their rates are reasonable, an astute shopper will find a lot of 3 and 4 star Istanbul hotels in that same price range. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Their flat is beautiful and comfortable, and the set-up with private bathroom is excellent. Their neighborhood has loads of lovely cafes and restaurant within easy walking distance. I wish I could have stayed longer. If they are free, I would love to stay with them when next visiting Istanbul. YOU SHOULD STAY HERE. I cannot recommend their place highly enough. ]]></description>

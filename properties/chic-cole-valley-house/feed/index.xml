Finding their place is a challenge; more importantly, its hillside location is hard on the legs, no matter who you are.

The guest bed is not very comfortable and should be replaced. 3. While their rates are reasonable, an astute shopper will find a lot of 3 and 4 star Istanbul hotels in that same price range. ]]></description>

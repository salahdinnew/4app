					<description><![CDATA[The room was very comfortable, the shower pressure and heat was perfect, the bathroom very clean. The view from their back deck was the highlight for us- and they were very kind to share the view! We enjoyed some wine and Turkish sweets on the deck for our last night. Additionally, the neighborhood is perfect!! Every corner there is a bar or restaurant or someone squeezing fresh juice for you. I would highly recommend this place!]]></description>
